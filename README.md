# DatagridWithSubModel

This is my first attempt at using Binding.subModel from Elmish.WPF and an indexed list from a DataGrid.

I failed miserably and am completely confused how to manage binding to a "Row List".

Here is a very failed attempt.

Thanks for any help and suggestions!

TIA

(The project solution is in the "View" folder.)
