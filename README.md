# DatagridWithSubModel

This is my first attempt at using Binding.subModel from Elmish.WPF and an indexed list from a DataGrid.

I failed miserably and am completely confused how to manage binding to a "Row List".

Here is a very failed attempt.

Thanks for any help and suggestions!

TIA

Attempted to move things arround. Being new to GitHub, is there a simple set of commands to update the master from the local computer? (Using the command line.). Thanks.
